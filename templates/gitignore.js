//We highly recommend adding a global git ignore file to every computer or server that is linked to your github repository.

//It allows git to ignore files you want to be hidden such as '.env'

//It is also recommended to not upload your node_modules package to github as that directory can become very large.

//These are what we recommend you have in your global gitignore file at minimum.  

//This should be saved as a file named ".gitignore" in your directory
